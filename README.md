# MathFun

-Abstract

The value of education is constantly growing in the world today. However, as education levels rise, learning issues become much more prevalent. Students' motivation to learn decreases along with these difficulties. It was thought how to solve this problem and it was decided to develop a game about learning mathematics, which is a difficult lesson. The subject of permutation-combination was chosen in the mathematics lesson. The main purpose here is to ensure that the student learns the subject of the course effectively and does not experience low motivation while learning. C # and Unity program were used as programming language during the production of the game. The figures used in the game were also taken ready-made from the internet. A design was made that could attract the attention of high school students and provide effective learning. With this game, it is thought that students will learn the topic they have chosen efficiently.
